- Good & Bad Use Cases, examples.

- Data Import into Neo4J (CSV, build Cypher statements or something else?)

- Subtleties of WHERE predicates with relationship queries (I always end up with an empty set!)

- Cypher basics & code snippets

- Design/Schema guidelines (e.g. when to use Labels vs properties)

- Neo4J GUI tips

- PowerShell & Neo4j (eeeekk!)

<p>Zuye is a Principal Architect at Salesforce in San Francisco, where he leads the development of the Salesforce Analytics experience for traditional reports and dashboards and ML augmented interfaces leveraging natural language and semantic graphs. Before that, he worked at Duetto Research and co-founded AppMesh.
We saw Zuye&#8217;s really interesting article a few weeks ago on <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/graphing-r-investing-and-r-wallstreetbets-c9f9f9276d69">Graphing r/Investing and r/Wallstreetbets</a> where he imported Reddit posts, comments, users, and stock symbols they talked about into Neo4j and ran a number of graph analysis experiments on them. We hope to see more cool uses of graphs coming from him in the future.</p>

<pre>Marco Falcier and Alberto D'Este have updated the popular neo4j-versioner-core library that allows users to handle data versioning in Neo4j.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This library helps keep track of entity state in the database. It is added as an extension, just like APOC or custom plugins would be. We can clone the repository, add it to the plugins directory in Neo4j, and restart the database. For more details on functionality and usage, there is <a href="https://github.com/h-omer/neo4j-versioner-core/blob/master/docs/index.md">documentation</a> in the Github repository.</p>

<p>Cristina wrote a blog post about how she and her colleague, Alisson, updated our <a href="http://portal.graphgist.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphGist portal</a>. The portal contains short, interactive examples of graphs with a variety of data sets and includes data models and sample queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cristina and Alisson migrated the existing application from a Ruby on Rails codebase to a new and improved GRANDstack structure. The blog post walks through how they did it - from data in the Neo4j database to GraphQL queries to the content approval process.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thank you, Cristina and Alisson, for the amazing work you did!</p>
